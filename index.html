        <li>
          <span class="judgment-term">Geometry and motion locked in too early.</span>
          Linkages, clearances, and motion profiles bake in stress and unintended contact; field wear is just the delayed report.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="judgment-term">Tolerance stacks treated as “close enough”.</span>
          Real assemblies — fits, runout, compliance, thermal growth — were never evaluated as a complete chain.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="judgment-term">Environment assumptions left implicit.</span>
          Dust, fluids, vibration, duty cycle, and operator behavior were assumed benign and never owned as hard constraints.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="judgment-term">Actuation and sensing coupled too tightly.</span>
          Motor, gearbox, joints, and feedback share failure modes, so minor drift cascades into behavior nobody predicted in tests.
        </li>
      </ol>

    <section class="block">
      <h2 class="block-heading">What you are already living with</h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Units that passed test behave differently after weeks or months in the field.</li>
        <li>Wear or drift appears where the design assumed “nothing important” was happening.</li>
        <li>Nominally identical builds show unexplained spread in behavior or failure timing.</li>
        <li>Patches and supplier changes help locally but the pattern of surprises continues.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="lead">
        If the pattern above matches your field behavior, the upstream decision pattern is clear enough to talk.
