        The aim is to match specific field behavior to the decision points that made it likely, not to re-litigate every design choice.

      <h2 class="block-heading">What we look at</h2>
      <ol class="judgment-list">
        <li>
          <span class="judgment-term">Where risk was consciously parked.</span>
          Design reviews, trade-off notes, and “non-blocking” concerns that were accepted to keep the program moving.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="judgment-term">Interfaces nobody fully owned.</span>
          Mechanical joints, electrical boundaries, thermal paths, and software-hardware seams where assumptions span teams.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="judgment-term">Field reality that diverged from models.</span>
          How the system is actually operated, maintained, and misused versus what the early models assumed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="judgment-term">Paths where variability piles up.</span>
          Tolerance chains, supplier spread, assembly steps, calibration, and control loops that quietly widen the state space.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="block">
      <h2 class="block-heading">What we intentionally ignore</h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Generic “best practices” checklists that do not explain your specific failures.</li>
        <li>Superficial claims that a single supplier, part, or firmware revision is “the” cause.</li>
        <li>Cosmetic changes that reduce embarrassment but do not change the failure surface.</li>
        <li>Arguments about abstract architectures that do not move a measurable risk boundary.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="block">
      <h2 class="block-heading">When we say “do not change this”</h2>
      <p>
        There are parts of a system that look awkward but are now load-bearing in ways nobody expected. We call out these areas explicitly when:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>They are compensating for deeper issues that are not yet ready to be addressed.</li>
        <li>They anchor a fragile equilibrium that would collapse if “cleaned up”.</li>
        <li>The cost of disturbing them exceeds the value of making them more elegant.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In those cases, we document why they must remain fixed while other changes are explored around them.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="block">
      <h2 class="block-heading">When we say “this will bite you later”</h2>
      <p>
        We flag decisions that are not yet failing in the field but are already structurally fragile. Typical patterns include:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Loads or duty cycles that are safe only under optimistic operator behavior.</li>
        <li>Calibration or maintenance steps that depend on rare discipline from busy teams.</li>
        <li>Interfaces where nobody is clearly responsible for what happens in the corner cases.</li>
        <li>Architectural choices that make future variants significantly harder than they appear.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These are written down plainly so leadership can decide whether to defer, accept, or address them now.
